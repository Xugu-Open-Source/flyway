subtitle: Filter Formats
---

SQL Server and Oracle have dedicated filter file formats.
All other database types with [Redgate comparison technology support](https://documentation.red-gate.com/flyway/flyway-concepts/database-comparisons) use the Redgate Compare filter format.

For more information on comparison filtering see [Comparison filtering]https://documentation.red-gate.com/flyway/flyway-concepts/database-comparisons/comparison-filtering().

For guidance on how to use Redgate Tools to update the filter files, see [Updating configurations](https://documentation.red-gate.com/flyway/database-development-using-flyway/updating-configurations)
