## Description

Whether to group all pending migrations together in the same transaction when applying them (only recommended for databases with support for DDL transactions)

_Note_:
- _If [executeInTransaction](<Configuration/Flyway Namespace/Flyway Execute In Transaction Setting>) is set to false, this parameter will have no impact._
- _This parameter does not apply to [callbacks](https://documentation.red-gate.com/flyway/flyway-concepts/callbacks), which can't be included in the same transaction._
- _This parameter does not apply to Native Connectors, as they [do not support transactions](https://documentation.red-gate.com/display/FD/Flyway+Native+Connectors+-+MongoDB)._

## Type

Boolean

## Default
