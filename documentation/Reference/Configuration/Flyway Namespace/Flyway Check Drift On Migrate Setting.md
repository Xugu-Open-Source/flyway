## Description

Enables automatic drift checks on migrate. Requires an online authentication method to be configured.
See [Flyway Licensing](https://documentation.red-gate.com/flyway/getting-started-with-flyway/system-requirements/licensing) for more details.
Also requires [`publishResult`](<Configuration/Flyway Namespace/Flyway Publish Result Setting>) to be set.

On migrate, a snapshot of your database schema is uploaded to [Flyway Pipelines](https://flyway.red-gate.com/).
Subsequent runs of migrate will compare the latest snapshot in Flyway Pipelines to your deployment target before script execution.
If your deployment target is different from the schema snapshot in Flyway Pipelines, a drift alert will be issued to Flyway Pipelines.

Check drift on migrate is an alternative to the [Check Drift](https://documentation.red-gate.com/flyway/flyway-concepts/drift-analysis) command.
