## Using Flyway with MongoDB Native Connectors
- Whilst this is in preview, you will need to set the environment variable `FLYWAY_NATIVE_CONNECTORS=true` on Redgate editions of Flyway.
- If you are using javascript migrations then you'll need [`mongosh`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/) to be installed.
- There is a [tutorial available here](/tutorials/tutorial---using-native-connectors-to-connect-to-mongodb).

## Observations
CosmosDB aims to be MongoDB compatible - as such we use the Flyway MongoDB infrastructure and can only verify that Flyway's verb testing works.
- We saw this error: `The request did not complete due to a high rate of metadata requests.` which was overcome by enabling `Server Side Retry` on the `Settings/Features` page on the CosmosDB management tool.

## Limitations
The [Flyway Native Connectors blog post](https://documentation.red-gate.com/display/FD/Flyway+Native+Connectors+-+MongoDB) describes more of the details of the Native Connectors changes.
- Transactions are only available with JSON migrations (these use the API and not Mongosh)
- Dry run is not available

## Terminology
We have to map Flyway concepts and language rooted in the relational database world to MongoDB - this is how Flyway sees the mapping:

| MongoDB Concept | Flyway Concept  |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| database        | database/schema |
| collection      | table           |
| row             | document        |
| transaction     | transaction     |
