## Using Flyway with MongoDB Native Connectors
- Whilst this is in preview, you will need to set the environment variable `FLYWAY_NATIVE_CONNECTORS=true` on Redgate editions of Flyway.
- If you are using javascript migrations then you'll need [`mongosh`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/) to be installed. 
- There is a [tutorial available here](/tutorials/tutorial---using-native-connectors-to-connect-to-mongodb).

## Observations
AWS DocumentDB aims to be MongoDB compatible - as such we use the Flyway MongoDB infrastructure and can only verify that Flyway's verb testing works.
- We saw this error: `MongoServerError: Retryable writes are not supported` which was overcome by adding `retrywrites=false` to the connection string, See [Functional differences: Amazon DocumentDB and MongoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/functional-differences.html#functional-differences.retryable-writes) 
- We had to set up an [SSH tunnel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/connect-from-outside-a-vpc.html) to work on DocumentDB from outside of the AWS VPC
- TLS is enabled by default on DocumentDB and requires the [Java Truststore to be set up to](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/tutorial-configure-ssl-for-database-connections-275218636.html) work with AWS.

## Limitations
The [Flyway Native Connectors blog post](https://documentation.red-gate.com/display/FD/Flyway+Native+Connectors+-+MongoDB) describes more of the details of the Native Connectors changes.
- Transactions are only available with JSON migrations (these use the API and not Mongosh)
- Dry run is not available


## Terminology
We have to map Flyway concepts and language rooted in the relational database world to MongoDB - this is how Flyway sees the mapping:

| MongoDB Concept | Flyway Concept  |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| database        | database/schema |
| collection      | table           |
| row             | document        |
| transaction     | transaction     |
