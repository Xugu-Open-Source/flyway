subtitle: Script Configuration 
---

It is possible to configure SQL migrations on a per-script basis.

This is achieved by creating a script configuration file in the same folder as the migration. The script configuration
file name must match the migration file name, with the `.conf` suffix added.

Script configuration files do **not** need to be explicitly listed in the main configuration or the command line.

For example, a migration file `V2__my_script.sql` would have a script configuration file `V2__my_script.sql.conf`.

Script Configuration files have a subset of the options from the other ways of configuring Flyway.
These parameters are effective at the level of a specific migration rather than globally.

## Structure

Script config files have the following structure:

```properties
# Settings are simple key-value pairs
key=value
```

## Available Settings
