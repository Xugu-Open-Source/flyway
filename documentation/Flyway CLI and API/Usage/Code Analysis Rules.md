# Code Analysis Rules
Flyway can call [SQLFluff](https://www.sqlfluff.com/) and include code violations in the [`check`](/Concepts/Check concept) report.

You can find more detail of these rules in the [SQLFluff rules](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/rules.html) description.

# Enterprise Rules
{% include enterprise.html %}

Redgate has added a set of additional rules that are of interest to customers with a larger and more complex database infrastructure.

Enterprise customers are also able to define their own rules - see [Creating Regular Expression Rules](Learn More/Creating Regular Expression Rules) 
## Flyway_L001 ( **[DEPRECATED]**, replaced by RX013)
_CREATE TABLE statement without a PRIMARY KEY constraint_

**Dialects:** All

It is best practice in most situations to define a primary key for each table. This can facilitate querying and ordering data 
## Flyway_L002 ( **[DEPRECATED]**, replaced by RX014)
_A table has been created but has no MS_Description property added_

**Dialects:** TSQL

Intrinsic documentation helps other database developers and can be used to generate documentation about the database.
## RX001
_DROP TABLE statement_

**Dialects:** All

Dropping a table is likely to result in the loss of data so should be investigated before continuing.
## RX002
_Attempt to change password_

**Dialects:** Oracle/PostgreSQL/TSQL

Changing passwords through a DB migration is not considered best practice

_TRUNCATE statement used_

**Dialects:** All

This operation is likely to result in a loss of data so should be investigated before continuing
