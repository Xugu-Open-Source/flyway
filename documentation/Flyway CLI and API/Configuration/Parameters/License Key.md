## Accessing Flyway Teams Edition artifacts

Flyway has different artifacts for Community and Teams edition. Therefore, in order to use Flyway Teams edition, you need to make sure you're using the correct artifact.

Once you're using the right artifact, you need to provide the license key in your configuration.

### Command line & Docker

The Flyway command line contains both Community and Teams edition artifacts. Therefore, you only need to provide your license key in your configuration, and Flyway Teams will start automatically. This also works for the Flyway Docker image.
