## SQL Script Syntax

- [Standard SQL syntax](Concepts/migrations#sql-based-migrations#syntax) with statement delimiter **;**
- $$ delimited strings

### Compatibility

- DDL exported by H2 can be used unchanged in a Flyway migration
- Any H2 SQL script executed by Flyway, can be executed by the h2 tools (after the placeholders have been replaced)

### Example

```sql
/* Single line comment */
CREATE TABLE test_data (
 value VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
);

/*
Multi-line
comment
*/

-- Sql-style comment

-- Placeholder
INSERT INTO ${tableName} (name) VALUES ('Mr. T');
INSERT INTO test_user (name) VALUES ( $$'Mr. Semicolon+Linebreak;
another line'$$);
```

## Known Vulnerabilities

H2 has a known [RCE vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMH2DATABASE-31685) that is unlikely to be fixed as it isn't enabled by default, and
it is not exploitable in Flyway's use of H2.

We will update our CLI to the fixed version as soon as it becomes available, but if this is a concern you can remove the H2 dependency if you do not require it
by deleting the `h2-<version>` JAR from the `drivers` folder

## Limitations

- Due to H2 limitations DOMAIN objects can only be cleaned in the current schema
